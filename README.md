# Federated Learning Project

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for a project focusing on privacy-preserving model aggregation in federated learning using Crypten.

## Project Description

This project explores secure and unsecure aggregation methods within federated learning. Using Crypten for encryption, we analyze the impact on data size and execution time. The experiments are conducted using a simple neural network model and simulated data to illustrate the effectiveness of privacy-preserving techniques.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need Python and the necessary Python packages installed, as well as Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Necessary Python packages: torch, crypten, numpy, matplotlib

### Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine

## Running the code

Navigate to the `Saad_Project_Code.ipynb` notebook in the Jupyter interface and open it.

Run the cells in the notebook to execute the experiments.

## Understanding the Notebook

The notebook is structured as follows:

- **Introduction**: Overview of the project and its objectives.
- **Setup**: Preparation and configuration necessary for the experiments.
- **Model Definition**: Defines the neural network model used in the simulations.
- **Data Simulation**: Describes how the dummy data is generated.
- **Experiment Execution**: Code to run the secure and unsecure aggregation experiments.
- **Results Analysis**: Visualization and interpretation of the results.
